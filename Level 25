Q. Now there is a 75 pixel column of weeds on the
left side of your garden.
3/5 of the remaining space is growing carrots,
while 2/5 has been overrun with weeds.

Use grid-template-columns with a combination
of px and fr units to make the necessary columns.

#garden {
  display: grid;
-------------------------
  grid-template-rows: 100%;
}

Solution:
grid-template-columns: 75px 3fr 2fr;
