Q.2 Welcome to Grid Garden, where you write CSS code to grow your carrot garden!
Water only the areas that have carrots by using the grid-column-start property.
For example, grid-column-start: 3; will water the area starting at the 3rd vertical grid line,
which is another way of saying the 3rd vertical border from the left in the grid.

#garden {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
  grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
}

#poison {
-----------------
}

Solution:
grid-column-start: 5;
