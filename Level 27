Q. grid-template is a shorthand property that
combines grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns.

For example, grid-template: 50% 50% / 200px;
will create a grid with two rows that are 50% each,
and one column that is 200 pixels wide.

Try using grid-template to water an area that
includes the top 60% and left 200 pixels of your garden.

#garden {
  display: grid;
-----------------------
}

#water {
  grid-column: 1;
  grid-row: 1;
}  

Solution:
grid-template: 60% / 200px;
