Q.10 Typing both grid-column-start and grid-column-end every time can get tiring.
Fortunately, grid-column is a shorthand property that can accept both values at once, separated by a slash.

For example, grid-column: 2 / 4; will set the grid item to start on the 2nd vertical grid line and end on the 4th grid line.

#garden {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
  grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
}

#water {
---------------
}

Solution:
grid-column: 4 / 6;
