Q.When columns are set with pixels,
percentages, or ems, any other columns
set with fr will divvy up the space that's left over.

Here the carrots form a 50 pixel column on the left,
and the weeds a 50 pixel column on the right.
With grid-template-columns, create these two columns,
and use fr to make three more columns that take up
the remaining space in between.

#garden {
  display: grid;
--------------------------------
  grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
}

#water {
  grid-area: 1 / 1 / 6 / 2;
}

#poison {
  grid-area: 1 / 5 / 6 / 6;
}

Solution:
grid-template-columns: 50px repeat(3, 1fr) 50px;
