Q. Your garden is looking great.
Here you've left a 50 pixel path at the bottom of your
garden and filled the rest with carrots.

Unfortunately,
the left 20% of your carrots have been overrun with weeds.
Use CSS grid one last time to treat your garden.

#garden {
  display: grid;
--------------------------------
}

Solution:
grid-template: 1fr 50px / 1fr 4fr;
