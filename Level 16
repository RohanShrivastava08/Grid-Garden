Q.16 If typing out both grid-column and grid-row is too much for you,
there's yet another shorthand for that.
grid-area accepts four values separated by slashes:
grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end,
followed by grid-column-end.

One example of this would be grid-area:
1 / 1 / 3 / 6;.

#garden {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
  grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
}

#water {
------------------
}

Solution:
grid-area: 1 / 2 / 4 / 6;
