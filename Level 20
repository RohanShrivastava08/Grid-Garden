Q.20 Up to this point, you've had your garden set up as a grid with five columns,
each 20% of the full width, and five rows, each 20% of the full height.

This was done with the rules grid-template-columns: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
and grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
Each rule has five values which create five columns,
each set to 20% of the overall width of the garden.

But you can set the grid up however you like.
Give grid-template-columns a new value to water your carrots.
You'll want to set the width of the 1st column to be 50%.


#garden {
  display: grid;
-------------
  grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
}

#water {
  grid-column: 1;
  grid-row: 1;
}

Solution:
grid-template-columns: 50% 50%;
