Q.3 When grid-column-start is used alone, the grid item by default will span exactly one column.
However, you can extend the item across multiple columns by adding the grid-column-end property.

Using grid-column-end, water all of your carrots while avoiding the dirt.
We don't want to waste any water!
Note that the carrots start at the 1st vertical grid line and end at the 4th.


#garden {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
  grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
}

#water {
  grid-column-start: 1;
------------------------
}

Solution:
grid-column-end: 4;
